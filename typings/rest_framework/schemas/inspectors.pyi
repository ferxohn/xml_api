        Enables `ViewInspector` as a Python _Descriptor_.

        This is how `view.schema` knows about `view`.

        `__get__` is called when the descriptor is accessed on the owner.
        (That will be when view.schema is called in our case.)

        `owner` is always the owner class. (An APIView, or subclass for us.)
        `instance` is the view instance or `None` if accessed from the class,
        rather than an instance.

        See: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html for info on
        descriptor usage.
